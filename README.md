Because I switch computers a lot.

Ruby scripts to install / uninstall my favorite terminal settings.

TODO:

Install should:
Make directory to hold all files
Copy existing settings new files for safe keeping
Homebrew install ack and fish
change terminal font
install janus
load new vimrc, bashrc, fishconfig

Uninstall should:
uninstall janus
uninstall ack and fish
revert to old vimrc, bashrc, terminal font, etc.
delete installation directory
