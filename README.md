Because I switch computers a lot.

Ruby scripts to install / uninstall my favorite terminal settings.

<strong>TODO:</strong>

Install should:
+ Make directory to hold all files
+ Copy existing settings new files for safe keeping
+ change terminal font
+ install pathogen and vim plugins
+ set git config
+ load new vimrc, bashrc, fishconfig

Uninstall should:
+ uninstall janus
+ uninstall ack and fish
+ revert to old vimrc, bashrc, terminal font, etc.
+ delete installation directory
